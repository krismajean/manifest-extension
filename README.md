> *Bringing light to the darkness*

Epstein Files Highlighter highlights names from the [Epstein files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_named_in_the_Epstein_files) as you browse. Click the icon next to any name to go directly to their entry on Wikipedia.

## How it works

When you visit any webpage, Epstein Files Highlighter scans the text for names listed in the Wikipedia article *List of people named in the Epstein files*. When a name is found:

- A small **highlighter icon** appears next to the name
- Optionally, the **name itself is highlighted** in yellow
- The extension's **toolbar badge** shows a count of total mentions on the page
- Clicking the icon opens that person's section on the Wikipedia list in a new tab

The extension starts with a built-in name list. You can update it from Wikipedia by clicking **Sync from Wikipedia** in the popup; Chrome may then ask for access to en.wikipedia.org. If you grant it, the list is fetched and cached locally. You can also enable **Auto-sync (every 24 hours)** in the popup; when that is on and permission is granted, the list refreshes automatically every 24 hours and on browser startup when the cache is stale. If you don’t grant access, the extension keeps using the built-in list.

## Features

- **Toolbar badge** — at-a-glance count of unique Epstein file names on the current page
- **Popup** — shows which names appear on the page and how many times each occurs
- **Toggle icon** — show or hide the highlighter icon next to names
- **Toggle highlight** — show or hide the colored background on matched names
- **Color picker** — choose your highlight and icon color from 7 options
- **Redact mode** — hides names under a black bar with a red outline, like a classified document; hover over the bar to reveal the name
- **Master on/off switch** — disable entirely with one click
- Works on any website, including dynamically loaded content (SPAs, infinite scroll)

### Redact mode

Selecting **Redact** in the highlight color options replaces the colored highlight with a solid black bar outlined in red — the name is hidden from view. Hovering over the bar reveals the name in white. This is useful if you want to notice *that* a name appears without immediately seeing *who* it is, or simply to make flagged names more visually striking on the page.

## Important disclaimer

**Appearing in the Epstein files does not mean a person has done anything wrong.** The files include names of victims, witnesses, associates, and people mentioned only incidentally. Epstein Files Highlighter makes no judgement about any individual — it simply shows you who appears, and lets you follow through to Wikipedia to read the context for yourself.

Matching is also by name only. Someone who shares a name with a listed person may occasionally be tagged in error. Always click through to verify.

## Development

To refresh the hardcoded name list from Wikipedia and create the Chrome Web Store zip:

```bash
python3 scripts/update.py              # update list + create epstein-files-highlighter.zip
python3 scripts/update.py --list       # only update content/names.js
python3 scripts/update.py --zip       # only create epstein-files-highlighter.zip
```

The zip is written to the project root (`epstein-files-highlighter.zip`).
